I have used socket io 

which basically provides 2 way communication in http you can send request to server but server will not communicate to you but in socket io we make request to server and server also emit the request to user.


I have used peer 


Which simplifies webRTC peer to peer data video , audio calls.
Peer js wraps the browser 's WebRTC implementation to provide a complete , configurable and easy-to-use peer to-peer connection Api..
